'''
Read in the first number from 'integers.txt' and perform a calculation
with it.
Make sure to catch at least two possible Exceptions (FileNotFoundError and ValueError)
with specific except statements, and continue to do the calculation
only if neither of them applies.

To test, try running it on:
- 'integers.txt' (should work)
- 'corrupted_integers.txt' (should fail with ValueError)
- 'nonexistent.txt' (should fail with FilenNotFoundError)
