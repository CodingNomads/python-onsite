CLASSES AND OOP
===============

Define a python class that describes a book object.

Every instance of the class should have a title, an author, a total page number, and a current page number (where the reader is at)

Further, define a method that allows a user to read a certain number of pages and updates the current page number accordingly.

Inform the user if they've reached the end of the book.
